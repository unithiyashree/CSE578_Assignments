# Extra Credit Assignment

For this optional extra credit assignment, you will create a programming homework assignment similar in design to homeworks #2 and #3. There are four deliverables that you will create and submit in this repository:

- Modify this README file to be your homework assignment's directions. You can use homeworks #2 or #3 as a guide. (Images for the readme should be stored in an `images` folder.)
- Create a folder named `template` in this repository. Inside, you will put the starter code for the assignment, such as an `index.html` page and any necessary Javascript or CSS pages and dataset files.
- Create a second folder named `completed` in this repository. Inside, put the codebase of the finished assignment (i.e., the modified `index.html`, Javascript, and CSS files, as well as any dataset files).
- Take a screenshot of your finished assignment, name it `image.png`, and put it here in this repository's root folder.

## README file

You will replace this readme file with the instructions for your created assignment. It should include the following:

- A title for your assignment.
- Add a short introduction describing the purpose of the assignment. In other words: what D3-related things you will learn by completing this assignment?
- Add a brief description of the dataset.
- Add a "To Start the Assignment" section that describes how to complete the assignment.
    - If you need to add a demo video (or gif) showing interactions, you may also include and reference those in this repository.
- Add the specific steps that the student should take to complete the assignment.
    - In other words, write out the specific code modifications required to go from the code in the `template` file to the code in the `completed` folder. You can write these similar to the homeworks #2 and #3 steps.
    - You must have a minimum of five steps in your assignment.
    - You should also include screenshots of your assignment along the way. Screenshots can be placed in the `images` folder and referenced in the readme.
    - If desired, you can include hints and reminders along the way.

## Template folder

Create a folder named `template` and put all starter code in it. At the very least, you should have an html file that links to D3 (can be either v5 or v6).

## Completed folder

Likewise, create a folder named `completed` and put the codebase for the finished assignment there. In other words, this is the code that a student would submit to get a 100% on the assignment. Just like your homeworks this year, the assignment should run via a Python simple server in Firefox.

## `image.png` Screenshot

Take a screenshot of the completed homework (i.e., based on what you have in the `completed` folder), name it `image.png`, and add it in this repository's root folder (this directory).

## Grading

This optional extra credit assignment is worth up to 1% of the overall course grade. I plan to use this assignment as inspiration when designing next year's homeworks, so to receive full credit you should create an interesting homework that explores D3 functionalities and techniques that were not used in this year's homeworks (i.e., don't use line charts, maps, scatter plots). You could look at techniques discussed in lectures, or review the D3 documentation or bl.ocks for ideas, or come up with your own inspiration! Grading will be based on creating a thoughtful assignment with clear directions and nice screenshots that is similar in terms of difficulty and complexity to the referenced homeworks #2 and #3. As a note, grade appeals are not allowed for this assignment.
